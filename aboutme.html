                        <h3>Junior Computing Student</h3>
                        <p>I am currently in my Junior year at the University of West Georgia majoring in Computing. Within this major, I have focused my learning on application and video game developement, as I have a drive to produce products that can engage with a user in a positive way.
                        Through my studies, I have strived for academic achievement through putting my best effort in each assignment. I believe that higher education is more then just the diploma that you receive at the end. It is about learning to be an effective member of a workplace through the improvement of not only your technical skills but emotional skills as well. </p>

                        <h3>Student Organizations</h3>
                        <p>I am in two student organizations here the UWG. The first being Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, which has taught me so much about communication and working with other people via the secretary executive postion I hold. It has helped me grow out of my shell and put myself forward as a skilled individual. It taught me a lot about time management,
                            scheduling, philanthropy, interpersonal communication, and teamwork. In addition to this, I am also the Vice President of the Association of Computing Machinery student chapter here, and although I am new to this role, it has brought me a lot understanding behind leadership and taking charge. I love having the connections with my peers that I have 
                            been able to achieve through my position, and firmly believe it will continue to help me grow.</p>
