                        <h3>Honors Graduate from CVHS</h3>
                        <p>I graduated highschool with honors from my scholastic abilities and with a Fine Arts Diploma Seal. I participated in NHS and NAHS throughout my highschool career, and I am very thankful for the lessons that I was able to draw from those experiences. I still encorporate all the creative aspects I learned into my development and problem solving processes. In addition. NAHS gave me a early insight into leadership with my position as Secretary leading me to guide our meetings and control a room. </p>

                        <h3>Dual Enrollment Student at UNG</h3>
                        <p>Due to my scholasitc diligence, I had the opportunity to spend my senior highschool year at the UNG Cumming Campus. In this program, I gained powerful insight into what I needed to improve on via the challenges that college level courses gave me. Throughout the two semesters I improved my self-dicipline and performed well in all my classes, acheiving 27 credit hours at the time of my High School graduation. I am very thankful for the opportunity and the lessons that I learned from the experience.</p>
