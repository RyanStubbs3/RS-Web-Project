                <h2>Additonal Qualifications</h2>
                <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
                <p>Throughout my lifetime I have worked to develop soft skills in order to be an effective member in any workplace. I believe my strongest of those skills are Creative and Analytical Problem Solving, Teamwork and Communication, Time Management, Adaptabile to Change, and Attention to Detail.</p>
                <p>The soft skill that I have worked to develop come from a long background of creative arts, customer service, and academic performance.
                    I hope to develop these skills even more, as I believe that one's soft skills are very intuitive to a employee's performance and capabilities beyond the measure of technical applications.</p>
                <h3>Hard Skills</h3>
                <p>It is within my academic career that I have focused on my technical capabilities via a heavy importance on my quality of academic learning and active practice of skills. From these experiences, I have gained a proficency in Generalized Tech Applications, Coding Languages including C#, Java, Python, CSS, and HTML, Project Management, UX/UI Driven Development, and Rudementary Data Analysis.</p>
                <p>These hard skills that I have developed in my academic career have been very useful for me and I am greatful to know these skills. I am a firm believer in taking no shortcuts with learning as it will only hurt my abilities, and through this methodology I have developed my abilities with confidence.</p>
